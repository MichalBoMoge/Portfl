My first bigger project, which took me over 4 months. It's simple chess game, containing every mechanic needed, outcluding checkmate and draw ;_;. I remember that Iwanted fully working chess quickly, so 
I just created two buttons for checkmate and draw, and after that I forgot to finish it off. In this project I'm using SFML library, already included.
