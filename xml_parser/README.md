Project for parsing XML files. I setted it up so can be opened via terminal. Program firstly analyzes index file from which takes out all paths to regular files (file named "spis.txt"). After that,
for every single file it takes name of register, next the instruction pattern, some parameters and generates final instruction. Also, it checks if same register can be used with different parameters,
if can be, creates every single one of them.
